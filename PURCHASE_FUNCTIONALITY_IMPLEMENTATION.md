# Purchase Functionality Implementation

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation of the purchase functionality for High Voltage Classifieds, including listing removal from the Listings page, seller notifications, and buyer purchase tracking.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Webhook Processing
**File**: `src/app/api/webhooks/stripe/route.ts`

- **Order Creation**: When a payment is completed, the webhook now creates an order record in the `orders` table
- **Listing Status Update**: Automatically marks listings as `is_sold = true` when payment is completed
- **Seller Notification**: Creates a notification for the seller when their listing is sold
- **Buyer Notification**: Creates a notification for the buyer when their purchase is successful
- **Email Notifications**: Sends email notifications to sellers about completed sales

### 2. Database Schema Updates
**File**: `src/lib/database.types.ts`

- **Orders Table Types**: Added complete TypeScript types for the `orders` table
- **Relationships**: Defined proper relationships between orders, listings, and users
- **Status Types**: Included all order status types (pending, paid, failed, cancelled, refunded)

### 3. Dashboard Purchase Tracking
**File**: `src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`

#### For Buyers:
- **Purchased Tab**: New tab showing all purchased items
- **Purchase History**: Displays purchased items with seller information, price, and purchase date
- **Empty State**: Helpful message when no purchases exist yet

#### For Sellers:
- **Sold Items Tab**: New tab showing all sold items (labeled as "Sold Items")
- **Sales History**: Displays sold items with buyer information, sale amount, and sale date
- **Empty State**: Helpful message when no sales exist yet

### 4. Listings Page Filtering
**File**: `src/app/listings/page.tsx`

- **Sold Item Filtering**: The listings page already filters out sold items with `.eq('is_sold', false)`
- **Available Listings Only**: Users only see available listings for purchase

## Database Changes

### Orders Table Structure
```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS public.orders (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
    listing_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES public.listings(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    buyer_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES public.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    seller_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES public.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    amount_paid DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
    payment_method TEXT NOT NULL,
    payment_intent_id TEXT,
    paypal_order_id TEXT,
    status order_status NOT NULL DEFAULT 'pending',
    shipping_address JSONB,
    notes TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### RLS Policies Required
**File**: `scripts/add-orders-rls-policies.sql`

The following RLS policies need to be applied to the orders table:

1. **View Policy**: Users can view orders where they are the buyer or seller
2. **Insert Policy**: System can insert orders (for webhooks)
3. **Update Policy**: System and users can update their own orders
4. **Performance Indexes**: Added indexes for better query performance

## User Experience Flow

### Purchase Process:
1. **Buyer** browses available listings (sold items are filtered out)
2. **Buyer** clicks "Buy Now with Stripe" on a listing
3. **Stripe Checkout** processes the payment
4. **Webhook** receives payment confirmation and:
   - Creates order record
   - Marks listing as sold
   - Sends notifications to buyer and seller
   - Sends email to seller
5. **Listing** disappears from the Listings page (filtered out)
6. **Buyer** sees purchase in their "Purchased" tab
7. **Seller** sees sale in their "Sold Items" tab

### Dashboard Tabs:
- **Buyers**: Favorites, Purchased, Messages, Account
- **Sellers (Unverified)**: Favorites, Purchased, Messages, Seller Setup, Account  
- **Sellers (Verified)**: My Listings, Sold Items, Messages, Payment Setup, Account

## Notifications System

### Seller Notifications:
- **Title**: "Listing Sold!"
- **Message**: "Your listing '[Title]' has been sold for $[Amount]."
- **Type**: Success notification

### Buyer Notifications:
- **Title**: "Purchase Successful!"
- **Message**: "You have successfully purchased '[Title]' for $[Amount]."
- **Type**: Success notification

## Email Notifications

### Seller Order Email:
- Sent to seller when payment is completed
- Includes listing title, sale amount, and order ID
- Uses Resend email service

## Technical Implementation Details

### Webhook Processing Order:
1. Validate webhook signature
2. Update payment status to 'completed'
3. Create order record with status 'paid'
4. Mark listing as sold
5. Create notifications for buyer and seller
6. Send email notification to seller

### Database Queries:
- **Purchased Items**: `orders` table filtered by `buyer_id` and `status = 'paid'`
- **Sold Items**: `orders` table filtered by `seller_id` and `status = 'paid'`
- **Available Listings**: `listings` table filtered by `is_sold = false`

### Performance Optimizations:
- Added database indexes for faster queries
- Used proper RLS policies for security
- Implemented efficient data fetching with joins

## Security Considerations

- **RLS Policies**: Ensure users can only access their own orders
- **Webhook Validation**: All Stripe webhooks are validated with signatures
- **Payment Verification**: Orders are only created after successful payment confirmation
- **Data Integrity**: Foreign key constraints ensure data consistency

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Purchase Flow**: Test complete purchase process from listing to dashboard
2. **Webhook Processing**: Verify webhook handles payment completion correctly
3. **Notifications**: Check that both buyer and seller receive notifications
4. **Email Delivery**: Confirm seller emails are sent successfully
5. **Dashboard Tabs**: Verify correct tabs appear for different user types
6. **Listings Filtering**: Ensure sold items don't appear in listings page

## Next Steps

1. **Apply RLS Policies**: Run the SQL script to add orders table RLS policies
2. **Test Purchase Flow**: Complete end-to-end testing of the purchase process
3. **Monitor Webhooks**: Set up monitoring for webhook processing
4. **User Feedback**: Gather feedback on the purchase experience
5. **Performance Monitoring**: Monitor database query performance
